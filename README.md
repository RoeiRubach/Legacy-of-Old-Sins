## General Info :mortar_board:

As mentioned, this is our final project for our production course studies.
I was the programmer in the team.
In this course we learn what it's like to be a part of a team / indie studio and develop a game from the very beginning.
```
Division into teams, division of roles among team members, writing GDD, using Trello, working under deadlines and to have a finished game at the end.
```
Beside that, we need to impress "investors" via pitch about our team, workflow and of course, the game.

## Project Status
